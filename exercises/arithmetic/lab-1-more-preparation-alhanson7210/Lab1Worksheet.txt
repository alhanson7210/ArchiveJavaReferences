Lab 1 Worksheet

1. What if 12 bits were used to store a signed integer. What is the biggest/smallest possible integer?

	A short would be the smallest integer, then it would be an int next, and then a long would be the biggest excluding using doubles and bytes.

2. Think about possible values and their range, say what type of variable would be suitable for the following, and suggest a name for it too.

For example: the temperature of a room in degrees Fahrenheit. Room temperature is likely to vary between say 50 degrees F and 100 degrees F,  but it can take any value in between including non-integers, e.g 71.19 F, so the type must be float or double depending on the accuracy required. A suitable variable name would be roomTemp.


(i) The number of pages in a book;

	int bookPages;

(ii) The number of atoms in a book;

	int atomCount;

(iii) The length of a side of a triangle in inches;

	float sideLength

(iv) Your name;

	String name;

(v) Whether or not a nucleus has decayed;

	boolean decayIsTrue;

(vi) The probability that it could have decayed.

	double decayProbability;

3. Start to do a little java programming!
	Follow the example of the Hello.java program and do some testing of Java int and float.
	Write a short class called “Arithmetic” that in its main method does the following:

		Creates 4 local variables
			Two ints (call them a and b)
			Two floats (call them x and y)
		Performs the following arithmetic operations on every combination of two of these
		and output using System.out.println each of the results
			Addition
			Division (in both directions)
